## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of our project seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by our team.

2. **Email**: Send a detailed report of the vulnerability to hello@brimmar.dev.

3. **Include the following in your report**:
   - A brief description of the type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations or workarounds
   - Your name/handle (if you wish to be credited)

4. **Response Time**: You can expect an initial response to your report within 48 hours, acknowledging receipt of your vulnerability report.

5. **Disclosure Process**:
   - I will investigate the issue and determine its severity and impact.
   - I aim to provide a timeline for addressing the vulnerability within 5 business days of the initial report.
   - I will keep you informed about the progress of addressing the vulnerability.
   - Once the vulnerability is fixed, I will notify you and discuss coordinated disclosure if applicable.

6. **Public Disclosure**: I kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until I have had a chance to address it and provide a fix. I typically aim to address vulnerabilities within 90 days, depending on their complexity.

7. **Recognition**: If you wish, I will credit you for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability after it has been resolved.

## What to Expect

- **Acceptance**: If the vulnerability is accepted, I will work on a fix and keep you updated on our progress.
- **Decline**: If I determine that the report is not a valid vulnerability, I will provide a detailed explanation of our decision.
- **Updates**: I will provide regular updates (at least once a week) on the progress of addressing the vulnerability.

I appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any security vulnerabilities you discover. Your assistance in keeping our project and its users secure is greatly valued.
